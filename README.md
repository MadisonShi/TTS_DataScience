Hi! My name is Madison Shi, and I'm a recent finance graduate from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX with minors in Computer Science, International Affairs, and Public Policy. I'm incredibly excited to start learning Python and the intricacies of data science. To me, data science is the exploration of data to find insights that can become a compelling story.
